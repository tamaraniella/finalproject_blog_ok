#getting rid of subjects that in the expeirment had some kind of problem (did't complete task well etc), and I am only keeping data from one participant per dyad, since initially, I will only look at answers that dyads answered together (same answer for both participants, I only need one)

```

# Plot 2's goal: 

A bar graph comparing the proportion of agreement (y-axis) between the interaction condition (interaction agreement) and the imagine condition (imagine agreement) (x- axis, 1 bar per group).

The goal would be to communicate whether participantâ€™s expectancy of agreement is different to the actual proportion of agreement when participants have a real interaction face-to-face.

## First version 

Proportion in the y-axis , some legends are too small

```{r try1p2}


#from plot 1 

#I want to see the dyad aswers for agreement (yes or no) for both stories, then I will create a new data set with one variable for agreement, that will iclude agreement for stories one and 2 and another variable that will indicate whether that agreement belongs to story 1 (freedom of speech) or 2 (cyber privacy)

mindset2 <- rep(dat_dyad$mindset, 2)
agreement <- c(dat_dyad$dyad_ag_s1, dat_dyad$dyad_ag_s2)
story <- as.factor(c(rep.int(1,36), rep.int(2,36)))


data<- data.frame(mindset2, agreement, story)

#change values of variable "story", names for numbers (I will only need this if I decide to show the proportions of agreement for the different stories - which is not totally relevant to the results of the study, so I am still debating about it )

data$story <- gsub("1", "Freedom of Speech", data$story)
data$story <- gsub("2", "Cyber Privacy", data$story)

#data set up

imagine <- import(here("sim_data_im.csv"))
data_im <- data.frame(imagine$s1_agrement_y_n, imagine$s2_agrement_y_n)

colnames(data_im)<- c("agreement_1im", "agreement_2im")

agreement_im <- c(data_im$agreement_1im, data_im$agreement_2im)
stories_im <- c(rep("Freedom of Speech", 34), rep("Cyber Privacy", 34) )
data_im_long <- data.frame(agreement_im, stories_im)

agreement_all <- c(agreement, agreement_im)
condition <- as.factor(c(rep.int("Interaction",72), rep.int("Imagine",68)))
stories_all <- as.factor(c(data$story, stories_im))

data_in_im <- data.frame(agreement_all, condition, stories_all)

#summary of proportions of agreement in imagine and interaction for plot 2 

summary_cond<- data_in_im%>% 
  group_by(condition)%>%
  summarize(prop_agreement =mean(agreement_all))

#JP Suggestion: 

summary_cond_s<- data_in_im%>% 
  group_by(condition, stories_all)%>%
  summarize(prop_agreement =mean(agreement_all),
            se_agree = sundry::se(agreement_all))

summary_cond_se1<- data_in_im%>% 
  group_by(condition)%>%
  summarize(prop_agreement =mean(agreement_all),
            se_agree = sundry::se(agreement_all))

summary_cond_se2<- data_in_im%>% 
  group_by(condition)%>%
  summarize(per_agreement =mean(agreement_all)*100,
            se_agree = sundry::se(agreement_all)*100)

#plot 2 - version without dividing by stories #NEW OK VERSION with error bars 

ggplot(summary_cond_se1, aes(condition, prop_agreement))+
  geom_col(alpha=.7, fill = c("#F1BB7B", "#FD6467"),width = .5)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = prop_agreement + qnorm(0.025)*se_agree,
                    ymax = prop_agreement + qnorm(0.975)*se_agree,
                    group = condition), size=.3, width= .2) +
  labs(title= "Agreement in Interaction  vs Expected Agreement in Imagine", x = "Condition", y = "Proportion of agreement")+
  theme_minimal()+
  ylim(0, 1)
```


## Second Version 

Increased font size for legends , changed proportion in the y-axis for percentage, for easier interpretation. 

```{r try2p2}


#NEW OK version of the plot above, with percentages, but with percentages signs: 


ggplot(summary_cond_se1, aes(condition, prop_agreement))+
  geom_col(alpha=.7, fill = c("#F1BB7B", "#FD6467"),width = .5)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = prop_agreement + qnorm(0.025)*se_agree,
                    ymax = prop_agreement + qnorm(0.975)*se_agree,
                    group = condition), size=.3, width= .15) +
  labs(title= "Imagined Agreement vs Interaction Agreement", x = "Condition", y = "Percentage of agreement")+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)+
  ylim(0, 1)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

```


# Final version: 

Changed colors for more color blind friendly ones. 

```{r finalp2}

#UPDATED VERSION - more color blind friendly colors #Darjeeling2 color palette

ggplot(summary_cond_se1, aes(condition, prop_agreement))+
  geom_col(alpha=.7, fill = c("#ECCBAE", "#046C9A"),width = .5)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = prop_agreement + qnorm(0.025)*se_agree,
                    ymax = prop_agreement + qnorm(0.975)*se_agree,
                    group = condition), size=.3, width= .15) +
  labs(title= "Imagined Agreement vs Interaction Agreement", x = "Condition", y = "Percentage of agreement")+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)+
  ylim(0, 1)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

## Interpretation: 

As we can see, out Hypothesis 2 is confirmed: people expect less agreement when they imagine having a discussion on a certain moral/political issue than the actual percentage of agreement when two people discuss that issue face to face.
